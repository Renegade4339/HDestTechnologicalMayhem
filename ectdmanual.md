# ECTD Teleporter Instructions

At least one battery must be loaded at all times to supply power to the device. To boot up, hit Use and Reload. Bootup time can go up to 10 seconds.

3 number displays then will display once it's fully booted. The HUD display will show the vectors along with their color: Red for X, Green for Y, and Blue for Z.

Hold Use and Firemode to see the configuration controls to configure the destination. Hold fire *twice* to teleport, each teleportation consumes 10 points of energy. Hit altreload key to switch between Absolute and Relative modes. Absolute mode to teleport to the exact coordinates while Relative mode to teleport to the sum of your coordinates and your configured coordinates.

The device also comes with a simplified version, which only requires the user to hold firemode while pointing at something to configure the destination coordinates. It, however, is extremely rare and can be found in automap spawns.
